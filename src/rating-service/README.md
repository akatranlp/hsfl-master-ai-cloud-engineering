### Service for rating chapters (unused)

Rate Chapters: The Rating Service allows users to assign ratings to individual chapters, influencing their visibility in search and trend results.

Impact on Search and Trend Queries: Ratings contribute to the positioning of chapters in search and trending lists, with higher-rated content appearing more prominently, and lower-rated content appearing further down the results.
